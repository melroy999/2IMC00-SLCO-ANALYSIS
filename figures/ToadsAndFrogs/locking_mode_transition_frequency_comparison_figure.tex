\caption{A bar plot that reports the number of successful executions $(se)$ and the percentage of successful executions $(sr)$ for each decision node and transition in the target model \texttt{ToadsAndFrogs}, where the results are grouped by the locking mode. Observe that the success count is depicted in a logarithmic scale, due to the wide range of measured values: the first column adheres to a linear scale; all subsequent columns are logarithmic. The results have been measured over a time span of 30 seconds, where each entry is represented by measurements taken over 20 trials.}
