\caption{A heat map plot that reports on the sum difference to the row minimum of the state machines' log message counts per time unit (milliseconds) for each log file generated during run 15 of target model \texttt{ToadsAndFrogs}. Each file has a maximum size of 100MB. The results have been measured over a time span of 30 seconds.}
